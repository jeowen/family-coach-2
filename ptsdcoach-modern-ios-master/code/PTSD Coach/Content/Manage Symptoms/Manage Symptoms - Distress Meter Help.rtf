\f0\fs22 \cf0 You can rate your distress level \'96 including negative feelings such as stress, anger, physical tension, and more, all rolled into one \'96 on a scale of 0 to 10. This will help you monitor your distress levels and figure out which tools work best for you. You can also use it in your daily life to check in and see how you\'92re doing.\
 It may seem strange at first, but sometimes we can get caught up in an all-or-nothing way of thinking\'96 either I\'92m totally uncomfortable or I\'92m totally fine. The distress score can help you learn to see the shades of gray, and help you see that even when things aren\'92t perfect, they may be improving. It can also help you learn to recognize what triggers distress for you.}
