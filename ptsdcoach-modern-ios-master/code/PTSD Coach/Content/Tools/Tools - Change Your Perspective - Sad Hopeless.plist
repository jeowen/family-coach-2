	<string>This is a hassle, not a horror.</string>
	<string>I have been through many hard things in my life and survived.</string>
	<string>I can tolerate this.</string>
	<string>This may seem hard now, but it will get easier and easier over time.</string>
	<string>I’ve done this before, so I know I can do it again.</string>
	<string>I can feel my heart beating and my feet on the floor.  I am alive and okay.</string>
	<string>I’ve been through worse before and made it through safely.</string>
	<string>I don't have to feel comfortable all the time.  That just proves I am human.</string>
	<string>This emotion will come and go.  I will feel differently in twenty minutes.</string>
	<string>I am able to respond effectively. I have skills to handle this situation.</string>
	<string>I have been through this before and been just fine.</string>
	<string>This is another challenge that I will figure out and face.</string>
	<string>These emotions are telling me something.  They won't hurt me.</string>
	<string>I am human.  I can make mistakes. No one is perfect.</string>
	<string>I can ask others for help.</string>
	<string>My thoughts are just thoughts; they’re not always right. Don’t believe everything you think.</string>
	<string>This feeling will pass.</string>
	<string>I will not feel this way forever.  I have felt differently before and will feel differently soon.</string>
	<string>The emotions I feel right now are giving me information about how I feel but they’re not necessarily based on facts.</string>
	<string>If I don't fight my emotions, they will go down on their own.</string>
	<string>I am a decent person.</string>
	<string>It is okay if it takes me time to figure this out.</string>
	<string>There is always time to learn.</string>
	<string>There are times when I will fall back into old patterns.  I just need to catch myself and get back on track with what's effective.</string>
	<string>It’s not always like this. There are times I have felt pretty amazing, too.</string>
	<string>I know that I deserve love.</string>
	<string>I am my own unique person: special, talented, and worthwhile.</string>
	<string>One night of poor sleep is not the end of the world.</string>
