	<string>I have been through many hard things in my life and survived.</string>
	<string>I can tolerate this.</string>
	<string>When this is over, I’ll be glad I did it.</string>
	<string>I’ve done this before, so I know I can do it again.</string>
	<string>I don't have to feel comfortable all the time.  That just proves I am human.</string>
	<string>This emotion will come and go.  I will feel differently in twenty minutes.</string>
	<string>I have been through this before and been just fine.</string>
	<string>This is another challenge that I will figure out and face.</string>
	<string>These emotions are telling me something.  They won't hurt me.</string>
	<string>I am human.  I can make mistakes. No one is perfect.</string>
	<string>I am able to protect myself.</string>
	<string>I can ask others for help.</string>
	<string>I have made the right decision before.</string>
	<string>My thoughts are just thoughts; they’re not always right. Don’t believe everything you think.</string>
	<string>I am strong.  I am safe now.</string>
	<string>I am in a safe place.</string>
	<string>I am a decent person.</string>
	<string>It is okay if it takes me time to figure this out.</string>
	<string>There is always time to learn.</string>
	<string>Learning will give me more options in the future.</string>
	<string>There are times when I will fall back into old patterns.  I just need to catch myself and get back on track with what's effective.</string>
